## DOM

Our entire web page consist of DOM itself (Document Object Model)

- it's a tree data structure
- it's comprised of parents & children
- a parent can have unlimited number of children
- children can have unlimited siblings
- a child can have only one parent

### Representation

```html
<div>
  <p>1st Child P tag</p>
  <p>2nd Child P tag</p>
  <p>3rd Child P tag</p>
</div>
```

- div tag becomes the parent tag
- p tag is the child tag

## Flexbox

Using the flexbox you are able to position and arrange the layout of the child elements using CSS properties . Majority of the flexbox properties apply on the Parent element, and some of them apply on the children element.

## Block Elements

Inside your HTML, any element that takes 100% width of the browser window is called a block element. Inline Element.
