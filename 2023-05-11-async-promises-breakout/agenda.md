# Asynchronous Code

- anything that takes time to run
  - asking user for a input
  - reading a file from disk
  - fetching data from the server
- run simultenously (for e.g reading files)
- It is preffered of doing things - because it's faster, it is non blocking, so we don't have to wait for one thing before we can start the other
